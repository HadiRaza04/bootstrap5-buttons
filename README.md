Practice on <b>Bootstrap 5</b> buttons style from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.</a>

1) The button classes can be used on <b><a</b>, <b>button></b>, or <b>input></b> elements.

2) Bootstrap 5 also provides eight <b>outline/bordered</b> buttons. Move the mouse over them to see an additional <b>"hover"</b> effect.

3) Use the <b>.btn-lg</b> class for large buttons or <b>.btn-sm</b> class for small buttons.

4) To create a block level button that spans the entire width of the parent element, use the <b>.d-grid "helper"</b> class on the parent element.

5) The class <b>.active</b> makes a button appear pressed, and the disabled attribute makes a button unclickable. Note that <b>a></b> elements do not support the disabled attribute and must therefore use the <b>.disabled</b> class to make it visually appear disabled.

6) You can also add <b>"spinners"</b> to a button, which you will learn more about in our <b><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_spinners.php">BS5 Spinners Tutorial</a><b>.
